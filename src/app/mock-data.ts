    blurb: `
      Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo,
      is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their
      mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before.
      Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there,
      but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable. As she
      retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others
      and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.

    publishDate: 2002,
    blurb: `
      Kafka on the Shore is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy,
      Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal
      prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging
      simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and
      now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities
      of daily life, he cannot fathom.

    blurb: `
      In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing
      cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that
      lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada
      encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a
      malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl;
      and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things
      he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.

    blurb: `
      A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and
      begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered,
      she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’
      A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a
      suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual
      author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled.

    cover: 'https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403184551l/397165.jpg',
    publishDate: 1999,
    blurb: `
      A college student, identified only as “K,” falls in love with his classmate, Sumire.
      But devotion to an untidy writerly life precludes her from any personal commitments–until
      she meets Miu, an older and much more sophisticated businesswoman. When Sumire disappears
      from an island off the coast of Greece, “K” is solicited to join the search party and
      finds himself drawn back into her world and beset by ominous, haunting visions. A
      love story combined with a detective story, Sputnik Sweetheart ultimately lingers in
      the mind as a profound meditation on human longing.
